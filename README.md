This paper tackles the topic of clustering Japanese Kanji. The general idea is to see if they can be clustered in way that we can draw some conclusions about i.e. ratio of the number of meanings of a Kanji to the complexity of that Kanji. The dataset was found on <https://www.kanjidatabase.com/>.

Clustering is done via K-Means and PAM. Celinski-Harabasz index is applied in post-diagnostics.
